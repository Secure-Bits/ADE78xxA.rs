# ADE78xxA.rs

Rust driver for the ADE78xxA Energy Monitoring IC

The ADE7854A / ADE7858A / ADE7868A / ADE7878A are high accuracy, 3-phase electrical energy measurement ICs with serial interfaces and three flexible pulse outputs. The devices incorporate second-order Σ-Δ analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), a digital integrator, reference circuitry, and all signal processing required to perform total (fundamental and harmonic) active, reactive (ADE7858A, ADE7868A, and ADE7878A), and apparent energy measurement and rms calculations.

## Work-in-progress
See [rs-register-generation](https://gitlab.local.securebits.com.au/common-lib/rs-register-generation) for the progress over bootstrapping development on this library.

Registers should be defined in `generation/source.toml`
